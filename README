HPAPL Research Repository
=========================

This is the research repository for HPAPL. It contains source code 
expirements, sketches, ideas, as well as the core HPAPL elements.

Here is an overview of the directory structure:

benchmarks
		This contains well known benchmarks implemented in various 
		languages, used to evaluate issues and problems in existing 
		systems, as well as compare HPAPL and related technologies 
		against well known metrics.
		
+-npb
  		These are the famous, straightforward NAS Parallel Benchmarks.
		We have implemented them partially in Chez Scheme, Dyalog, 
		and have versions that were written elsewhere for Matlab, 
		and the reference implementation of the benchmarks.
		Stubs for various HPAPL elements to hash out ideas are also 
		in here.

compiler
		This directory contains many sketches and approaches to a
		compiler for HPAPL. Some of these contail runtimes, and 
		others contain just compilers. They use various implementation
		techniques and most of them must be considered forays 
		into possible approaches, rather than complete compilers.
		
+-vN
		Each of these directories represents a progression of 
		ideas in the design of the system.
		
extra
		This director contains miscellanous elements, mostly in 
		the form of book keeping or the like. There are some ideas
		that came from my work with Dyalog in here as well.
		
ide
		These are design thoughts that I write down whenever I start 
		thinking about what an user interface to this language 
		might look like.
		
isabelle
		This is the directory containing the work on a mechanization 
		of HPAPL.
		
papers
		Any static, unchanging, published or released papers are 
		put here. These documents are expected to be either archival 
		or unchanging in form, and are here for reference
		or documentation.
		
qthread
		An import of the qthread library for lightweight threading.
		
research
		This directory contains papers and bibliographies 
		of interest. They may include potentiall tangential papers 
		or other notes, but they came up at some point in the 
		design of HPAPL.
		
runtime
		This was an early draft of a potential runtime, to flesh 
		out ideas.
		
tests
		This is where some tests were placed early on to get a 
		feel for what HPAPL might feel like.
		
upc
		This directory contains all things about the UPC libraries 
		and the compiler.
