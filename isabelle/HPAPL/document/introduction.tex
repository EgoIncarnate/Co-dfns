\section{Introduction}

APL was conceived as a notation for the manipulation and clearer 
communication of array oriented mathematics, as a means of operationally 
working with arrays at a level abstract and direct enough for 
mathematical practices (citation needed). Today, APL as a language 
presents a number of attractive, compelling features for the description 
of solutions to problems commonly found in high-performance computing, 
combinatorial algorithms, as well as numerical analysis, a traditional 
strong suit that has made APL popular in the actuarial and financial 
sectors. Traditional APL applies most neatly to problems whose solutions 
find elegant expression in terms of aggregate, data parallel operations. 
These solutions are often disarmingly concise.
